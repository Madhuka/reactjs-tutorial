  - Composable components

###Composable components
React is all about modular, composable components.
Instances of a React Component are created internally in React when rendering. These instances are reused in subsequent renders, and can be accessed in your component methods as 
```js
this
```
The only way to get a handle to a React Component instance outside of React is by storing the return value of 
```js
React.render()
```
